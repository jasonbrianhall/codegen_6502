# Data Labels Configuration
# One label per line - these labels will be treated as DATA (generate pointers)
# Lines starting with # are comments
#
# Examples of typical data labels:
# GameText
# AreaAddrOffsets
# MusicData
# PaletteData
#
# Add labels here that contain lookup tables, graphics data, etc.
